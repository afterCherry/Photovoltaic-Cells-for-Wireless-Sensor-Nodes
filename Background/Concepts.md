- black body radiation  <br>
The amount and intensity of radiation[W/m2] a body sends out is solely determined by its surface temperature.
According to the laws of defined formula, an object at a certain temperature emits electromagnetic radiation across a range of wavelength. To be specific, warmer objects emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths.
- equilibrium temperature of the earth  <br>
Equilibrium temperature happens between incoming solar radiation and outgoing earth radiation. Incoming Energy in Visible/U;traViolet(UV), Outgoing Energy in Infra-Red(IR). Incoming absorbed radiation on Planet depends on distance to the sun and radius of the planet, outgoing radiation of the planet only depends on its temperature.
Planet Earch will heat up until equilibrium is achieved. The resulting equation for equilibrium temperature does not depend on the size of planet.

CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O  <br>
Vibrational modes exist in all molecules, if these modes change the dipole moment of the molecule, they can absorb radiation in the infra-red which was emitted by earth's surface. They re-transmit radiation in random direction, including back to the Earth's surface, which drives further to increase the Earth's temperature and increase the overall energy input to the Earth's surface, leading to an imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy.
