# Past years
## GreenHouse Effect 
### in terms of black body radiation and the equilibrium temperature of the earth. 
[21/22][6']  [20/21][6'] [19/20][6']  [18/19][6'] [17/18][6']  [16/17][6']
- black body radiation  <br>
The amount and intensity of radiation[W/m2] a body sends out is solely determined by its surface temperature.
According to the laws of defined formula, an object at a certain temperature emits electromagnetic radiation across a range of wavelength. To be specific, warmer objects emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths.
- equilibrium temperature of the earth  <br>
Equilibrium temperature happens between incoming solar radiation and outgoing earth radiation. Incoming Energy in Visible/UltraViolet(UV), Outgoing Energy in Infra-Red(IR). Incoming absorbed radiation on Planet depends on distance to the sun and radius of the planet, outgoing radiation of the planet only depends on its temperature.
Planet Earch will heat up until equilibrium is achieved. The resulting equation for equilibrium temperature does not depend on the size of planet.
![equilibrium temperature](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/equilibrium%20temperature.png) <br>
![equilibrium1](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/equilibrium1.png) <br>

### caused by Gas, explain examples and principles. 
[22/23][6'] <br>
CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O  <br>
Water Vapour(H2O) near full absoption in spectrum so does not matter if we add a little more. Carbon Dioxide(CO2) adds further absorbtion, create new and higher equilibrium temperature, which might lead to some nasty side effects. <br>

Vibrational modes exist in all molecules, if these modes change the dipole moment of the molecule, they can absorb radiation in the infra-red which was emitted by earth's surface. They re-transmit radiation in random direction, including back to the Earth's surface, which drives further to increase the Earth's temperature and increase the overall energy input to the Earth's surface, leading to an imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy.

## heat pump
the concept, operation, and performance of a heat pump as used for domestic heating, discussing both ground source and air source heat pumps. 
[21/22][6']  [19/20][6']
- concept: Heat is pumped from cold to hot by utilizing the principles of thermodynamics, not extracted from a heat source (unlike geothermal)
- operation: Pump Cycle (expansion and condensation of water)
1. Heat extraction
Air Source (ASHP) will work poorly in freezing temperature: currently not sufficient as stand alone. It pulls in air from the surrounding environment using a fan, then the fluid absorbs heat from the air through the evaporator. <br>
Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) needs to be implemented in new build homes. A GSHP extracts heat from the ground using a network of buried pipes, called ground loops, filled with a heat transfer fluid.
Both often relevant to the water mixed with antifreeze.<br>
- performance: Measured by COP (Coefficient of Performance). <br>
2. Heat transfer <br>
The fluid passes through the compressor. The compressor increases the fluid's temperature and pressure.<br>
3. Heat distribution: The heated fluid passes through the condenser, releasing the heat to the indoor air or a water-based heating system.<br>
- performance: coefficient of performance
![heat pump](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/heat%20hump.jpeg)
Typical efficiency η of 500%! Works best when temperature difference is small. Energy dissipation slow at low temperature so need well insulated house kept at constant temperature. Because of the stable ground temperature, the GSHP generally offer higher COP values, while ASHP will work poorly in freezing temperature.

## thermo-electrical generator(TEG)
the relation between efficiency and the figure of merit of a thermo-generator. Define each symbol. 
![thermo-electrical generator](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/thermo-electric%20generator.png) <br>
- Z: the figure of merit
- T: the absolute temperature of the thermoelectric material(in kelvin)
- 6: the electrical conducting of material
- k: the thermal conductivity of the material
- a: a=dV/dT the thermopower seebeck coefficient, which measures the megnitude of the voltage generated when a temperature gradient is applied across the material

![efficiency](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/efficiency.png) <br>

When ZT is increased, the efficiency of the TEG is enhanced, allowing for higher conversion efficiency of heat into electrical power. Because higher ZT implies a better balance between 6, a, and k,leading to improvment of the thermoelectric performance.

## AGW(Anthropogenic Global Warming)
the mechanism by which burning of fossil fuels leads to anthropogenic global warming. <br>
[19/20][12'] [18/19][12'] [17/18][12'] [16/17][7'] <br>
Evidences of AGW are Co2 emission, temperature increase and feedback.
When fossil fuels are burned, the greenhouse gases such as CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O will accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere. The gases will absorb the IR emitted from the earth's surface and reemit to the earth's surface, which leading to the imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy of the earth and increasing temperature. The increased temperature will melt the glaciers and rise sea levels, which reduces the Earth's reflective capacity and increases the absorbtion that creates vicious cycle.

## carrier selective contact
![selective contact](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/selective%20contact.png)
a. PERC(Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell)
Explain, with the help of a sketch, how the structure of the back contact of a PERC solar cell differs from that of an Al-BSF solar cell and give two reasons why it enables higher power conversion efficiencies. 
[19/20][5']
Structure Extra steps vs. BSF cell
1. Rear passivation with SiOx/AlOx and SiNy. 后端屏障层
2. Laser contact opening at rear. 激光

why it enables higher power conversion efficiencies: <br>
- Less recombination at rear contact (most of the rear is covered with a passivating oxide).
- A higher reflectance from the back surface dielectric stack compared to an Al-Si interface.

cons: <br>
still some metal-silicon interface at which recombination can occur. <br>
local contacting has its downside: <br>
– More complex fabrication steps to create pattern at rear. <br>
– Base resistance must be low so high quality wafers needed for high PCEs. <br>

b. AI-BSF
Back Surface Field created by extra heavy P type doping keeps electrons away from surface.<br>
![multicrystalline BSF](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/multicrystalline%20BSF.png) <br>


c. TOPcon(Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact)
- Adding a heavily- doped n+ layer of polysilicon between the oxide
and the metal contact provided selectivity to electrons.

The passivated contact is selective to electrons because:
1. Heavily doped n+ poly-Si creates band bending to provide a barrier for holes while electrons can migrate easily to the
oxide/silicon interface.
2. The tunnel oxide presents a 4.5 eV barrier for holes relative to 3.1 eV for electrons
3. No states on the other side of the oxide (n+ region) for holes to tunnel through because of the energy gap.

【题目解读】
- Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell
- 在太阳能电池中，前端是光吸收层（活性区域），负责将光能转化为电能；而背面则用于电池的电子通道和电流收集。
- 屏障层:
  - 在太阳能电池的背面形成一个钝化层，可以减少电子和空穴的表面复合。电子和空穴的复合是一个能量损失的过程，可以降低太阳能电池的效率。通过背面的钝化氧化物层，可以有效减少这种复合现象，从而提高电池的效率。
  - 还具有一定的反射特性，可以将未被吸收的光线反射回到活性区域，增加光的吸收率，提高电池的光电转换效率。

## MPPT

1.basic boost converter;
2.buck converter;
3.buck boost converter;
[21/22][8'] [16/17][16']
(i) The basic principle of Maximum Power Point Tracking is to ensure that the PV system operates in its region of maximum power output from the PV cells . This means modulating the load from the PV Array to optimize the voltage and current. To achieve this, we need to monitor the input voltage and current of the PV array and ensure that the current drawn through the load is then matched with the correct current from the PV array using DC-DC converters <br>
![circuit](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/circuit.png) <br>
(ii) Indirect methods estimate the MPP by monitoring and analyzing the system parameters such as voltage, current and power. They are simple to implement and have a fast response. <br> 
a. Fixed Voltage Method <br>
b. Fractional Open Circuit Volatge Method <br>
Limitations: <br>
- Model suited for places with low variation of irradiance
- Not accurate

The wafer in (c) is made into an Al-BSF solar cell with a screen-printed aluminium back contact. During the process, the cell is heated to diffuse aluminium into silicon, creating a p+ layer at the rear of the cell with an acceptor concentration of Na+ = 3×1018cm-3. 
Draw and label a band diagram of the p+/p junction formed at the rear of the cell and explain how this helps improve the performance of the solar cell. <br>

![bsf delta ec](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/BSF%20delta%20ec.jpeg) <br>


The cell is heated to diffuse 扩散 aluminium from the back contact into sillicon.<br>
- High doping concentration creates a potential gradient in conduction and valance band.
- It can be seen that the nergy difference between Fermi level and valence band becomes smaller as moving into p+ region
- It's smaller in the conduction band which produces barrier to the minority carriers. The band structure on the back surface that obstruct the movement of minority carriers, such as electrons, towards the region connected to the metal contace, which reduces the recombination at the rear of cell and improve the efficiency of the solar cell.

Explain why the law of mass action is true for extrinsic semiconductors. <br>
[21/22][4'] <br>

In extrinsic semiconductors, intentionally added dopant atoms significantly increase the concentration of majority carriers (electrons in N-type semiconductors or holes in P-type semiconductors), resulting in a much higher concentration of majority carriers (n or p) compared to the concentration of minority carriers (p or n). <br>

To maintain equilibrium, the decrease in hole concentration caused by the donor impurities is balanced by an increase in electron concentration. This maintains the product n*p proportional to ni^2, as described by the law of mass action.


在外延半导体中，有意添加的掺杂原子显著增加了多数载流子的数量（N型半导体中的电子或P型半导体中的空穴），因此多数载流子的浓度（n或p）远远超过少数载流子（p或n）的浓度。<br>

- g<1 Negative feedback: earth regulates itself: “Gaia” <br>
  - True long term: Might not include human survival though <br>
  - Short term: <br>
    - Additional cloud raises albedo <br>
    - Ocean will continue absorption of CO2 from atmosphere <br>
- g>1 Positive feedback: <br>
  - Increased water concentration in atmosphere leads to further green house effect <br>
  - Ice cover decreases which decrease albedo <br>
  - Tundras melt releasing CH4 (strong greenhouse gas) <br>
  - CO2 absorption of oceans stops or reverses strongly increasing CO2 ppm <br>

## radiative forcing
Explain the concept of radiative forcing. <br>
[18/19][5']
It refers to the response of climate system to an initial pertubation or change in one or more climate variables.It represents the amplification or dampening of the initial change.<br>
Power of Radiation [W/m2] not escaping earth due to absorption by green house gasses
If radiation already absorbed at that wavelength there is less additional forcing; depends on:<br>
• Position of vibrational levels <br>
• Amount of the greenhouse gas in the air <br>
• Amount of other greenhouse gasses at same wavelength <br>
• Details of the vibrational modes (shape around wavelength) <br>
【题目解读】<br>
Radiative forcing用来衡量温室气体对地球辐射能量的影响。当大气中的温室气体增加时，它们会吸收更多的辐射能量，导致地球表面的辐射能量不平衡，使得更多的能量被保留在地球上，从而引起温室效应和全球变暖。

## active region of a solar cell
two advantages and two disadvantages of using silicon as the material for the active region of a solar cell. <br>
[19/20][4']
To be a suitable material from which to make the active layer of solar
cells, a semiconductor should ideally have the following properties:<br>
- Band gap should be 1-1.6 eV. As for silicon, the band gap is 1.1eV. <br>
– Need to be able to dope n and p type (to form a good junction) <br>
– Low defect densities (long minority carrier diffusion lengths). 低缺陷密度（长少数载流子扩散长度）： 缺陷密度影响材料的载流子（电子和空穴）传输和寿命。<br>
– Abundant on Earth<br>
X Should absorb light efficiently. （迷惑）

shortcoming:<br>
1. Limited spectral response range: The spectral response range of silicon solar cells is mainly concentrated in the visible light region, with low absorption capacity for infrared and ultraviolet light, and cannot fully utilize light energy other than visible light.<br>
2. Thermalization loss: When a photon is absorbed by a silicon semiconductor, it generates an electron-hole pair. Some of these carriers may have too much energy that cannot be converted directly into electricity, but instead into heat through a process called thermalization. This loss of thermal energy reduces the overall efficiency of the solar cell.<br>
【题目解读】"Active region of a solar cell" 是指太阳能电池的活性区域，也称为光吸收层或光电转换层，其主要功能是将光能转化为电能。这个区域的材料选择至关重要，因为它直接影响太阳能电池的光电转换效率。

name two semiconductors possessing each type of band gap. 
[19/20][6'] [18/19][6'] [17/18][6'] [16/17][3'] [14/15][5']
- Direct bandgap
e.g. GaAs, InP, InAs, CdTe
Transitions of electrons from VB(valence band) to CB(conduction band) involve an energy change only. <br>
absorption of light: When the energy of the photon matches or exceeds the energy of the band gap, the electron can directly jump from the VB to CB.<br>
emission of light: When an electron returns from the conduction band to the valence band, it releases excess energy as a photon. Due to the nature of direct transitions, electrons do not experience large momentum changes when emitting photons.<br>

- Indirect bandgap
e.g. Si, Ge, GaP, AlP
Transitions of electrons from VB to CB involve a change in energy and momentum. <br>
absorption of light: Although the energy of the photon may be higher than the bandgap energy, the electron cannot jump directly from the valence band to the conduction band due to the momentum mismatch.<br>
emission of light: When electrons return from the conduction band to the valence band, due to the mismatch of momentum, additional scattering and momentum changes will occur, making the emission efficiency of photons lower.<br>

## H2 fuel cell powered vehicle and an H2 combustion engine
the similarities and differences between an H2 fuel cell powered vehicle and an H2 combustion engine in terms of chemical process, energy efficiency and CO2 emission. <br>
[21/22][5'] <br>
燃料电池 vs. 内燃机 <br>
- chemical process (different)
H2 fuel cell powered vehicle: The hydrogen gas is fed to the anode, oxygen from air is supplied to the cathode. At anode, hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons. The protons move through the electrolyte, while the electrons create an electric current, which can power an electric motor. At the cathode, the protons H+ and electrons e- combine with O2 to produce H2O as the only product.<br>
2H2 —> 4H+ + 4e- <br>
O2+4e —> 2O2- <br>
4H+ + 2O2- —> 2H2O <br>

H2 combustion engine: 2H2 + O2 —> 2H2O. H2 is burned in an internal combustion engine, similar to a conventional gasoline engine. The H2 is mixed with air, compresses, and ignited by a spark plug. The byproduct of H2 combustion is water vapor H2O.

- energy efficiency (different)
H2 fuel cell powered vehicle: 化学能 电能 动能 <br>
Conversion from chemical energy to electrical energy to motion. it is more energy-efficient, the efficiency is typically around 60%.

H2 combustion engine: 化学能 热能 动能/电能 <br>
Conversion from chemical energy to heat to motion or electricity. It is inefficient, heat engine limited by carnot cycle: <br>
![inefficient](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/inefficient.jpeg) <br>
The efficiency is typically from 25% - 45%.


- CO2 emission (similar)
H2 fuel cell powered vehicle: produce O direct CO2 emissions during operation. The only byproduct is H2O and overall CO2 emissions depend on the source of H2(Hydrogen) production.


H2 combustion engine: also produce O direct CO2 emissions during operation. However, if the H2 is derived from fossil fuels, such as natural gas, there maybe CO2 emissions associated with the production process.

- chemical process (different)
H2燃料电池动力车：氢气被送入阳极，氧气从空气中供应到阴极。在阳极，氢分子被分解成质子和电子。质子穿过电解质，而电子产生电流，可以驱动电动机。在阴极，质子H+和电子e-与氧气O2结合，产生唯一的产物H2O。

2H2 —> 4H+ + 4e-
O2+4e —> 2O2-
4H+ + 2O2- —> 2H2O

H2燃烧发动机：2H2 + O2 —> 2H2O。氢气在内燃机中燃烧，类似于传统的汽油发动机。氢气与空气混合，压缩，并通过火花塞点燃。氢燃烧的副产物是水蒸气H2O。

- energy efficiency (different)
H2燃料电池动力车：化学能 -> 电能 -> 动能
将化学能转换为电能，再转换为运动能量。它更加高效，其效率通常约为60%。

H2燃烧发动机：化学能 -> 热能 -> 动能/电能
将化学能转换为热能，再转换为运动能量或电能。它效率低下，受卡诺循环限制的热能引擎。

- CO2 emission (similar)
H2燃料电池动力车：在运行过程中不产生直接的CO2排放。唯一的副产品是H2O，整体CO2排放量取决于H2（氢气）的生产来源。

H2燃烧发动机：在运行过程中也不产生直接的CO2排放。然而，如果H2来自化石燃料，比如天然气，可能会与生产过程相关的CO2排放。

# Supplementary content for examination
## Types of Solar Insolation
- Direct Nominal Irradiance (DNI): Radiation received per unit area by a surface that is held
perpendicular to (or normal to) the direction of the sun at a given time in space
- Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): Radiation received per unit area by a surface (not subject to any
shade) that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun but has been scattered by molecules and
particles in the atmosphere
- Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): The total amount of radiation received from above by a surface
horizontal to the ground

## measure
- DHI: Pyranometers are used, alongside a shadow ball that blocks the direct sunlight.
- DNI: mounted on a solar tracker
- GHI: pyranometer placed horizontally, facing the Sky.
- Global Tilted Irradiance (GTI): pyranometer is tilted
- diffuse reflection from the surface of the earth: pyranometer is facing downwards instead of towards the sky

## Pyranometer
How a Pyranometer works? <br>
- A pyranometer operates by measuring the temperature difference between a clear surface
and a dark surface based on the Seebeck effect or thermoelectric effect
- The black coating of the thermopile sensor absorbs solar radiation; in contrast, the clear
surface reflects it.
- Solar radiation heats up the sensor and increases the electric current it produces, so the
more sunlight there is, the hotter the sensor becomes

## Pyrheliometer
How a Pyrheliometer works?
- Through a window, sunlight enters the instrument and is directed at a thermopile, which
transforms heat into an electrical signal due to the Seebeck Effect.
- The signal voltage is then converted to watts per square meter with the help of a formula.
- The Seebeck effect occurs when the temperature differential of dissimilar electrical conductors or
semiconductors generates a voltage difference between them.

## GAS window layer
A larger band gap window layer is often added to reduce front surface recombination:
– Potential barrier reflects minority carriers (electrons), preventing them reaching the front surface (similar to the BSF for silicon solar cells).
– Window layer is transparent to light due to larger bandgap.

# Common Sense
- Solar cell & photovoltaic cell: 同一个概念，通常用来指代太阳能电池。

太阳能电池是一种能够将太阳光直接转换成电能的装置，它通过光电效应产生电流，从而将光能转换为电能。太阳能电池通常由半导体材料制成，当光线照射到太阳能电池的表面时，光子的能量被吸收，从而产生电子-空穴对，这些电子-空穴对会形成电流。

因为太阳能电池是基于光电效应工作的，所以它也被称为"photovoltaic cell"，其中"photo"表示光的意思，"voltaic"表示电的意思，因此"photovoltaic cell"意味着直接将光转换为电能的装置。
- 光伏电池效率：电子更容易进入硅材料，形成电流。空穴更难进入介电材料，最大程度地减少载流子的复合损失，并提高太阳能电池的效率。
- 低缺陷密度是指材料中缺陷（如晶格缺陷、杂质、陷阱等）的数量较少，这意味着少数载流子（空穴或电子）在材料中扩散时不太容易受到障碍，因为缺陷会限制载流子的移动。在半导体器件中，较低的缺陷密度可以帮助提高载流子的寿命和扩散长度，从而增强器件的性能和效率。
- 本征费米能级（𝐸𝑖）是指在纯净半导体中（没有有意添加杂质的情况下），导带中的电子浓度和价带中的空穴浓度相等的能量水平。
- 能隙中心是导带最小值（CBM）和价带最大值（VBM）之间的中点。
- 能带又可以分为价带和导带。带隙能量（Eg）是指价带和导带之间的能量差，即电子在价带中的最高能级与导带中的最低能级之间的能量间隔。价带是离子束缚电子的能带，其中电子能量较低，通常处于较稳定的状态。导带是电子能量较高且能够自由移动的能带。当电子从价带跃迁到导带时，它们能够在材料中自由移动并参与电导。
带隙（band gap）是价带和导带之间的能量间隔，也称为禁带宽度。在带隙中，材料的电子处于不允许的能量状态，无法自由传导。
- When holes and electrons meet and recombine, their energy is lost as heat instead of being converted into electricity.
- Doping impurity atoms are typically classified into two categories: donors and acceptors.
  - In N-type silicon, the donor is the doping impurities. The additional electrons from the donor atoms easily dissociate and become free electrons in the conduction band, thereby increasing the conductivity of N-type silicon. On the other hand, acceptor atoms are impurities that can capture free electrons and can be considered as positively charged carriers, thereby increasing the conductivity of the doped region.
  - In P-type silicon, the acceptor is the doping impurities.
