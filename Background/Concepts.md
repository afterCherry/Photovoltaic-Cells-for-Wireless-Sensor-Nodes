# Concepts
## GreenHouse Effect 
### in terms of black body radiation and the equilibrium temperature of the earth. 
[21/22][6']  [20/21][6'] [19/20][6']  [18/19][6'] [17/18][6']  [16/17][6']
- black body radiation  <br>
The amount and intensity of radiation[W/m2] a body sends out is solely determined by its surface temperature.
According to the laws of defined formula, an object at a certain temperature emits electromagnetic radiation across a range of wavelength. To be specific, warmer objects emit more radiation at shorter wavelengths.
- equilibrium temperature of the earth  <br>
Equilibrium temperature happens between incoming solar radiation and outgoing earth radiation. Incoming Energy in Visible/U;traViolet(UV), Outgoing Energy in Infra-Red(IR). Incoming absorbed radiation on Planet depends on distance to the sun and radius of the planet, outgoing radiation of the planet only depends on its temperature.
Planet Earch will heat up until equilibrium is achieved. The resulting equation for equilibrium temperature does not depend on the size of planet.

### caused by Gas, explain examples and principles. 
[22/23][6'] <br>
CO2, H2O, CH4, N2O  <br>
Water Vapour(H2O) near full absoption in spectrum so does not matter if we add a little more. Carbon Dioxide(CO2) adds further absorbtion, create new and higher equilibrium temperature, which might lead to some nasty side effects. <br>

Vibrational modes exist in all molecules, if these modes change the dipole moment of the molecule, they can absorb radiation in the infra-red which was emitted by earth's surface. They re-transmit radiation in random direction, including back to the Earth's surface, which drives further to increase the Earth's temperature and increase the overall energy input to the Earth's surface, leading to an imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy.

## heat pump
the concept, operation, and performance of a heat pump as used for domestic heating, discussing both ground source and air source heat pumps. 
[21/22][6']  [19/20][6']
- concept: Heat is pumped from cold to hot, not extracted from a heat source (unlike geothermal)
- operation: Pump Cycle (expansion and condensation of water)
- performance: Measured by COP (Coefficient of Performance).
![heat pump](https://github.com/afterCherry/Photovoltaic-Cells-for-Wireless-Sensor-Nodes/blob/main/Background/Images/heat%20hump.jpeg)
Works best when temperature difference is small. Energy dissipation slow at low temperature so need well insulated house kept at constant temperature
- Air Source (ASHP) will work poorly in freezing temperature: currently not sufficient as stand alone
- Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) needs to be implemented in new build homes.

## AGW(Anthropogenic Global Warming)
the mechanism by which burning of fossil fuels leads to anthropogenic global warming. 
[19/20][12'] [18/19][12'] [17/18][12'] [16/17][7']
Evidences of AGW are Co2 emission, temperature increase and feedback.
When fossil fuels are burned, the greenhouse gases such as CO2, H2O will accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere. The gases will absorb the IR emitted from the earth's surface and reemit to the earth's surface, which leading to the imbalance between incoming and outgoing energy of the earth and increasing temperature. The increased temperature will melt the glaciers and rise sea levels, which reduces the Earth's reflective capacity and increases the absorbtion that creates vicious cycle.

## Carbon
Explain the role of the carbon electrode in a Li-ion battery. 
[19/20][3'] [17/18][3']
The stable carbon electrode works as a barrier electrode for storing and releasing li-ions during the charging and discharging processes, which allows for efficient electrons transfer.

## AM
the definition of AM 0 and AM 1.5 radiation 
[19/20][3'] [18/19][3'] [17/18][3']
AM(Air Mass)
- AM 0 represents the solar spectrum then the sunlight directly perpendicularly reaches to the Earth's surface without attenuation through the atmosphere.
- AM 1.5 represents the solar radiation spectrum after passing through an average atmosphere with a path length of 1.5 air masses.

[19/20][6'] [18/19][6'] [17/18][6'] [16/17][3'] [14/15][5']

- A P-type silicon wafer has an acceptor concentration Na= 2×1016 cm-3. The wafer is made into an Al-BSF solar cell. During the process, the cell is heated to diffuse aluminium from the back contact into silicon, creating a p+ layer at the rear of the cell with an acceptor concentration of Na+ = 4×1018 cm-3.<br>
a) Draw and label a band diagram for the rear of the cell and explain how
the BSF helps improve the performance of the solar cell.[7'] <br>
[7'] <br>
High doping concentration creates a potential gradient in valence and conduction band, which can be seen that the energy difference between fermi level and valence band becomes smalleras moving to p+ region. It's similar in the conduction band which produces barrier to the minority carriers.
The band structure on the back surface that obstruct the movement of minority carriers, such as electrons, towards the region connected to the metal contace. The goal is to prenvent minority carriers from recombining with holes at the back surface by guiding the minority carriers towards the juction, which can help to reduce the likelihood of recombination losses, thereby improving the efficiency of the solar cell. <br>

[10'] <br>

1. Heavily doped n+ polisillicon creates band bending to provide a barrier for holes while electrons can migrate easily to the oxide/sillicon interface <br>
2. The tunnel oxide presents a 4.5eV barrier for holes relative to 3.1 eV for electrons <br>
3. No states on the other side of the oxide(n+ region) for holes to tunnel through because of the energy gap <br>
The 3 features keep  holes away from metal surface, which can help to reduce the likelihood of recombination losses, thereby improving the efficiency of the solar cell. <br>

# Common Sense
- When holes and electrons meet and recombine, their energy is lost as heat instead of being converted into electricity.
- Doping impurity atoms are typically classified into two categories: donors and acceptors.
  - In N-type silicon, the donor is the doping impurities. The additional electrons from the donor atoms easily dissociate and become free electrons in the conduction band, thereby increasing the conductivity of N-type silicon. On the other hand, acceptor atoms are impurities that can capture free electrons and can be considered as positively charged carriers, thereby increasing the conductivity of the doped region.
  - In P-type silicon, the acceptor is the doping impurities.
